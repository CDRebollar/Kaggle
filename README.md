## [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (titanic-project.ipynb)](https://github.com/CDRebollar/Kaggle/blob/main/titanic-project.ipynb)
In this project, I developed an ensemble model to predict passenger survival based on factors such as name, age, gender, socioeconomic class, and more. The model utilized a straightforward voting mechanism, aggregating predictions from various models including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, naive Bayes, KNN, sequential, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier.
